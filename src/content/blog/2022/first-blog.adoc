This post explains steps to generate and deploy  personal blog site

== TechStack

=== JBake
JBake is a Java based, open source, static site/blog generator founded by Jonathan Bullock for developers & designers (https://jbake.org/) .The main highlights of JBake are

* Open Source - Source available on GitHub, licensed under MIT License
* Cross platform support - The binary distribution runs on Windows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X.
* Content Formats - Supports AsciiDoc, Markdown and good old HTML formatted content.
* Open Structure - Structure your content any way you see fit.
* Blog Aware - RSS/Atom feed, archive and tag support.
* Draft support - View your draft content before publishing it and making it available to the world.
* Self contained - Binary distribution contains everything you need apart from a JRE, no complicated environment setup with 3rd party dependencies.
* Build tools - Plugins available for Gradle, Maven, mill, SBuild and sbt.
* Template Support - Freemarker, Groovy, Thymeleaf, Jade and Pebble based templates & scripting support.
* CSS Framework Support - Easily integrate CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation.
* Custom Metadata - Add as much metadata to content as you like, also exposed to templates.
* Storage Support - Store your site content in Dropbox, CVS, SVN, Git or whatever you want.

=== Gradle
In this post I used  Gradle  to build the static content and deploy the website using Github actions

=== GitHub Pages
GitHub pages (https://pages.github.com/) is a hosting service provided GitHub which help GitHub users to their website directly from github repo .

=== GitHub Action
GitHub action is a CI/CD service provided by GitHub

== Steps for Setting up your Blog

. Setup the GitHub Repository
+
- login to github and create new public repository
+
image:/img/first-blog/git_create_project.JPG[Create Public Repository]

- clone the repo into your local  either by using IDE's or command line
+
[source,ruby]
----
git clone https://github.com/fazeem84/TestJBake.git
----

. Setup JBake using gradle
+
- add build.gradle and include JBake gradle plugin as shown below
+
----

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath  'commons-configuration:commons-configuration:1.10'
    }
}

plugins {
    id 'org.jbake.site' version '5.5.0'
}
bakeInit {
    template = 'freemarker'
}


----
+
this plugin has capability of downloading the template to your source folder from a url or a pre-defined teamplate available in JBake GitHub Repo for more information please check https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-gradle-plugin/blob/master/README.adoc

- Execute Gradle JBake Init command
+
----
gradle bakeInit
----
+
This will generate the following folder structure with template source code
+

+
if you want know more details about the folders inside directory please refer https://jbake.org/docs/2.6.7/#project_structure

- Execute bake step
+
bake step will transform  the source  contents  in different format like .md,adoc etc to pure html ,bake step can be triggered using following gradle command
+
----
gradle bake
----
+
Once it's successfully executed the static content will be generated under build folder
+

- Running web server from your local environment
+
run following gradle command to start the webserver, the server will be running on 8080 port by default
+
----
gradle bakePreview --no-daemon
----
+

. Setup GitHub Action
+
This section describes how to run gradle bake command once the code  pushed to the master branch and in this example we have set up a separate branch to host git hub page so last step of build execution is to copy the gnerated files into the specified branch

+
- Make sure you have all permission to run the GitHub action https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository
- create a new branch(gh-pages) from where the git hub page will be served in future steps
- create .git/workflow folder and create yaml/yml file build file and copy paste  the following code and check-in/push the repository into github(Make sure your committing tha gradle folder and gradle related file in the  root folder )
+
----
name: Jbake-WorkFlow
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,
  # but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      -
        name: "Set up JDK 11 "
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          distribution: adopt
          java-version: "11"
      -
        name: "Validate Gradle wrapper"
        uses: gradle/wrapper-validation-action@e6e38bacfdf1a337459f332974bb2327a31aaf4b
      - name: Make gradlew executable
        run: chmod +x ./gradlew
      -
        name: "Build with Gradle"
        run: "./gradlew bake"
      -
        name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.7
        with:
          BRANCH: gh-pages
          FOLDER: build/jbake
----
- after pushing the code build will kick start in the action section and generated file will be copied to a new branch (gh-pages in this example,please check deploy stage in yaml file)

+
Source Code is available in https://github.com/fazeem84/TestJBake

. Setup GitHub Page
- Navigate to repository settings and select the branch from which the website is being server from (gh-page in our example) and save the settings
